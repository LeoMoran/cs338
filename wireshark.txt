===== DAYTIME =====
1. Identify the parts of the TCP 3-way handshake by listing the frame summaries of 
the relevant frames.
1 192.168.197.128 129.6.15.28 TCP [SYN] Seq = 0 Win=32120 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSval=4186346171 TSecr=0 WS=128
2 129.6.15.28 192.168.197.128 TCP [SYN, ACK] Seq = 0 ACK=1 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460
3 192.168.197.128 129.6.15.28 TCP [ACK] Seq = 1 ACK=1 Win=32120 Len=0

2. What port number does the client (i.e. nc on your Kali computer) use for this 
interaction?
The port the client is using is 50118

3. Why does the client need a port?
So that the server has a place to send it to, the client maybe using multiple softwares and without a port number, 
the server won't know where to send it's data. To fix this problem, the client get a randomly determined number for 
it's port number.

4. What frame contains the actual date and time? (Show the frame summary as in 
question 1 above.)
Frame 4 contains the actual wanted data
4 129.6.15.28 192.168.197.128 DAYTIME DAYTIME Response

5. What do [SYN] and [ACK] mean?
SYN means to syncronize, they send a randomized number over and expect to recive 
it back. ACK means to achknowledge the request that was sent to them.


6. Which entity (the nc client or the daytime server) initiated the closing of 
the TCP connection? How can you tell?
I believe the nc client initiated the closing since on frame 5 there is a FIN packet
that signifies the closing of the TCP connection, and the source of the frame 
was 192.168.197.128, which is the same source as the initial SYN packet, which I know 
to be sent by the client. Therefore, the client initiated the closing of the TCP
connection.


===== HTTP =====

To get this segment to work, I used host 172.223.221.124 instead of the given one 
within the assignment since the given one would not work when I tried to make the 
http requests.

1. How many TCP connections were opened? How can you tell?
I think two TCP connections were made, because I only saw two TCP handshakes within 
the first 7 frames (1, 2, 3, 7), there is also two sets of info that states Client 
Hello and Server Hello.

2. Can you tell where my homepage (index.html) was requested? (If not, why not? If 
so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your answer.)
7 192.168.197.128 172.233.221.124 HTTP GET /index.html HTTP/1.1


3.Can you tell where my photograph (jeff-square-colorado.jpg) was requested? (If 
not, why not? If so, include frame summaries and/or other info that supports your 
answer.)
11 192.168.197.128 172.233.221.124 HTTP GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1


=====   QUESTIONS =====

What does the shading represent? When I did the http of Jeff's website I got 4 TCP 
protocol columns that were gray, but then two columns that were black (TLSv1.3 and 
another TCP), which everything slese was shaded in the same lighter gray. Then 
there were two more columns that were black that had orange text instead of white.
(For the black shading and orange text, the protocol was TLSv1.3 33634 [TCP Window Full])
