Project Proposal

Contributors: Leo Moran

Summary: I want to research what makes for a secure password.

Presentation: I will research industry standards and complexity standards for the 
formation of passwords in order to better understand how these different organizations 
try to remain safe and to learn about the different elements behind a good password.

Deliverables: Research and devise a summary of guidelines behind forming a secure 
password. Write a paper describing the comparisons between company standards.
